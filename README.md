## About me
Hi there! Welcome to my website! I am a 14 year old coder, guitarist and an avid reader! I really like to make stuff on scratch I like to code a bunch of 3d stuff in a software called Blender. Recently I have moved a way from scratch a little bit and worked more on coding in python and HTML/CSS/JavaScript. You can find my projects over on my GitHub account. In my spare time I like to code, read, play guitar, and.... Code more. ðŸ¤¦ Right now I am working with a few other scratchers to code an amazing (okay, of course I'd think that) browser extension. It pretty much gives you scratch superpowers! This includes searching blocks, seeing how much a project is loaded, viewing deleted comments and much more! You can check that out over on the ScratchAddons official website or on the GitHub repository for it.
